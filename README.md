## Vehicle-CO2-Emission-Analysis

In this project, I gathered a dataset containing information about vehicles' CO2 emissions from a CSV file. I then performed data cleaning by removing unnecessary columns and addressing duplicate and empty rows. During the data analysis phase, I conducted statistical examinations, grouping the data by factors such as the make, model, vehicle class, fuel type, engine size, and transmission of the vehicles.

The main goal of this analysis was to uncover valuable insights and patterns regarding the changes in CO2 emissions based on different variables in the dataset. To make these findings more accessible, I employed visualization techniques. For instance, I used histograms to display the distribution of CO2 emissions. Additionally, I utilized bar charts to showcase the manufacturers, vehicle classes, fuel types, engine types, and cylinder counts associated with the highest emissions.

This process helped me understand how various factors contribute to CO2 emissions from vehicles, and the visual representations made it easier to communicate these insights clearly to others.
