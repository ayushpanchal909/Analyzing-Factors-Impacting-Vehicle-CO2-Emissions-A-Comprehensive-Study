## Vehicle-CO2-Emission-Analysis

In this project, I gathered a dataset containing information about vehicles' CO2 emissions from a CSV file. I then performed data cleaning by removing unnecessary columns and addressing duplicate and empty rows. During the data analysis phase, I conducted statistical examinations, grouping the data by factors such as the make, model, vehicle class, fuel type, engine size, and transmission of the vehicles.

The main goal of this analysis was to uncover valuable insights and patterns regarding the changes in CO2 emissions based on different variables in the dataset. To make these findings more accessible, I employed visualization techniques. For instance, I used histograms to display the distribution of CO2 emissions. Additionally, I utilized bar charts to showcase the manufacturers, vehicle classes, fuel types, engine types, and cylinder counts associated with the highest emissions.

This process helped me understand how various factors contribute to CO2 emissions from vehicles, and the visual representations made it easier to communicate these insights clearly to others.

### Objective of Analysis

>What is the most common range of CO2 emissions (in g/km) among the vehicles in the dataset, as indicated by the highest frequency on the histogram?

>What is the average CO2 emission level for vehicles with different engine sizes and cylinder counts, and is there any noticeable trend or pattern in how these factors relate to the emissions?

>Which manufacturer/vehicle class/fuel type/transmission type/cylinder count/engine size is associated with the highest CO2 emissions among the top 10 contributors, and how significant is the difference in emissions compared to the other entries on the bar chart?

The dataset comprises 7385 vehicles, with an average engine size of approximately 3.16L and an average of around 5.62 cylinders. The mean CO2 emission level stands at 250.58 g/km. Variability in these figures is evident, with engine sizes spanning from 0.9L to 8.4L, cylinder counts from 3 to 16, and CO2 emissions from 96 to 522 g/km. Most common engine sizes and cylinder counts fall within the range of 2.0L to 3.7L and 4 to 6 cylinders, respectively.

Among various car manufacturers, Bugatti exhibits the highest average CO2 emissions at 522.00 g/km, reflecting a potentially high-performance and powerful nature of their vehicles. Comparatively, Lamborghini follows with an average of 400.78 g/km, suggesting a similar focus on performance. On the other end, Land Rover records the lowest average emissions of 287.65 g/km, possibly indicating an emphasis on more environmentally conscious designs.

<br>
Analyzing vehicle classes, it's evident that passenger vans exhibit higher CO2 emissions, averaging 397.21 g/km, likely due to their size and capacity. Cargo vans follow at 361.50 g/km. SUVs, which are popular for their versatility, have an average of 304.84 g/km, while smaller pickups average 278.97 g/km. Comparatively, more fuel-efficient classes like subcompact cars and mid-size station wagons show lower emissions, with averages of 246.45 g/km and 238.70 g/km, respectively.

<br>
Diverse fuel types show varying average CO2 emissions. Vehicles running on fuel type E (ethanol) exhibit an average of 275.09 g/km, likely due to ethanol's lower energy content. Z (compressed natural gas) follows at 266.04 g/km, while diesel (D) vehicles average 237.55 g/km. Gasoline (X) and hybrid (N) vehicles display lower emissions, with averages of 235.12 g/km and 213.00 g/km respectively, showcasing their comparatively cleaner energy profiles.

The data on CO2 emissions based on engine size reveals a notable trend. Vehicles with larger engine sizes tend to have higher average emissions. For instance, vehicles with an engine size of 8.0L exhibit the highest average CO2 emission at 522.00 g/km. As engine sizes decrease, emissions generally follow suit. This suggests that vehicles with larger engines, often associated with higher performance or larger vehicle types, have a more significant environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions.

<br>
The data concerning CO2 emissions categorized by transmission type unveils a connection between transmission technology and emissions. Vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions (such as A10, A7, A5) tend to exhibit slightly higher average CO2 emissions, ranging from 315.16 g/km to 298.63 g/km. In contrast, transmissions denoted as AS or AM show relatively lower emissions, suggesting that certain automatic or semi-automatic transmissions contribute to more efficient fuel utilization and reduced emissions.
